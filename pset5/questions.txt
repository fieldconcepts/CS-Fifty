0.  A very long word, 45 chars long, the max our program will be able to check.
1.  Returns the struct containing the usage stats of the prgram unclusing CPU time, emory usage etc.
2.  16 members in the struct
3.  
4.  Once the file has been opened in read mode it iterates through each charcter in the text
    int c is initialised as the first character in file and the loop continues to iterate until c
    reaches the End OF File character. Each charcter is check if it is alphabetical and if it passes
    then it is added to a word array at index i. The word array is checked to make sure its length
    does not exceed 45, the max word length for this program. if it exceed 45 then the loop continues
    to the end of this particular word and reset the index to 0 at the end, marking a new word found.
    if a number is found within the word then the same, loop conitunes through the rest of the word 
    until end of word. If full word is found that is valid, increase the word counter and check for 
    mispelling by calling check() fucntion. rest index zero for next work in text.
