1.  stdint.h file is a header file in the stnadrad library that specifies a set of typedifs for integrers with exact widths, MIN and MAx values.
2.  Signed and unsigned interger types of fixed widths as defined by the stdint.h header file. This prevents errors when code is ported from a eg. a 16bit vchaine to a 32bit machine.
3.  BYTE=1bytes, DWORD=4bytes, LONG=4bytes, WORD=2bytes
4.  Hexdecimnal = 0x4d42
5.  bfSize = total size of the bitmap file including headers, pixels, padding (in bytes). biSize = size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER struct (in this case 40 bytes). 
6.  If biHeight is negative then the bitmap is top-down DIB and its origin is in the upper-left corner.
7.  biBitCount specifiess the bitmap color depth or Bits Per Pixel.
8.  fopen will return a NULL if the file does not exist.
9.  the "1" means read 1 time from the streams pointed by the inptr the data size sizeof(BITMAPFILEHEADER) ansd store to memory address of the variable bf
10. padding = 1
11. fseek is a fucntion used to set the file position indicatoor for the stream to a new postion. In this case it take the file stream, moves the postion indicator by amount of padding, and SEEK_CUR is the postion at which it should start offsetting (current)
12. SEEK_CUR is the current position of the pointer.
